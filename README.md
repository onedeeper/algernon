# Algernon

Algernon is a desktop agent that plays tic-tac-toe with you when you're sad. She uses OpenCV to watch the faces of humans infront of the camera. If she notices that the human has been sad for a certain amount of time, she tries to get his/her attention for a game of Tic-tac-toe. Algernon plays her game using ** depth first search ** except that 1/3 of the time, she plays a random move which gives the chance for the human player to win. Otherwise, it just wouldn't be fun.

Algernon also queries a website to try and get an inspirational quote for you at the conclusion of the game to keep you motivated.
